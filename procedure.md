1. Initiate the process by clicking on the **CREATE** tab.
2. Now, select whether you want to use a predefined dataset or create your own dataset.
    <ul type="circle">
    <li>If, predefined data selected then jump to step 5.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, continue to the next step(3).</li>
    </ul>

3. Input the values for **Sepal Length** and **Sepal Width**, and select a **Species** from the attributes section. Afterward, click on the **ADD** button.
4. Repeat the third step up to **12** times for data augmentation.
5. Progress to the next stage by clicking on the **NEXT** button.
6. Record the values of **Sepal Length** and **Sepal Width** into the Testing dataset, and then add them by clicking on the **ADD** button.
7. Navigate to the next phase by clicking on the **NEXT** button.
8. Choose the desired value for **K**, submit your selection by clicking the **SUBMIT** button, and then advance by clicking the **NEXT** button.
9. Determine the Euclidean distance between your new data point and the dataset by utilizing the **DISTANCE** button located below the table.
10. Establish the order of the distance (i.e., its position in the sorted list) by clicking on the **RANK** button.
11. Continue the analysis by clicking on the **NEXT** button to assess the category of the Testing data.
12. Visualize the K-Nearest Neighbors on the graph by clicking on the **PLOT** button.
